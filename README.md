# React-Redux-Thunk Example

The package shows how to use [Redux-Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) along with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) language.
I also use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) in this example.

To run the package.

```
git clone https://github.com/aliaksandrminsk/react-redux-bootstrap-task.git
cd react-redux-bootstrap-task
npm install
npm run start
```

To run tests.

```
npm run test
```
